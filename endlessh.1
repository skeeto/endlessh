.Nm endless

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an SSH tarpit that very slowly
sends an endless, random SSH banner.
.Pp
.Nm
keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time.
The purpose is to put your real SSH server on another port
and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit
instead of bothering a real server.
.Pp
Since the tarpit is in the banner before any cryptographic
exchange occurs, this program doesn't depend on any cryptographic
libraries. It's a simple, single-threaded, standalone C program.
It uses poll() to trap multiple clients at a time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces

.It Fl j Ar jitter
Randomizes the delay by j% (0-100). Default: 0 (no jitter)
